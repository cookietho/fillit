# fillit
## Goals
##### Create a program that takes a file as a parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to creat the smalleset square possible. The main goal for this project is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time.
## Mandatory part
##### The project must be written in C and must respect the Norme coding standard.
##### The allowed functions are : exit, open, close, write, read, malloc, and free.
##### Makefile must compile the code without relinks.
##### No leaks
## What I learned from this
##### This was my first algorithm project in 42. I had to write a program that finds the smallest square possible with the set of Tetriminos that is given as a file. My project partner Jeff Ding and I decided to use recursion and Backtracking to find the most efficient way to solve this project. Recursion is a useful technique in programming that checks the same problem over and over by creating a function that calls itself.
## How to use
##### 1.Git clone https://github.com/cookietho/fillit.git
##### 2.cd to fillit directory
##### 3.run make to compile and link the sources
##### 4.make will create an excutable file called fillit
##### 5.excution:   ./fillit test   (example)
